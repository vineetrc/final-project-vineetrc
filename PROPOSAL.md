# Project Proposal

## Project Idea
For this project, I am going to create a classic 8-ball pool game using the cinder library. I have chosen this project as I beleive that it will be a good showcase of my overall c++ skills with the graphics, user interface, and rules that need to be programmed in. I have had experience playing this game and is a good extension of what I have done in cinder so far.

## Description
When the program is run, I will have a window with the pool table being displayed on the screen. Then the game will begin by instructing players to take turns hitting the balls with the pool stick. I am hoping for a shot meter on the stick so the force applied can be varied. At the end, the screen will display the winner of the game. 

# Goals 
Minimum Viable Product - a game board where the cue ball is able to be hit by a player. 

Week 1 Goal: Set Up Game Board Screen and ball physics (velocity/friction etc.)

Week 2 Goal: Set up Pool Stick Movement and shot meter

Week 3 Goal: Implement Game rules. Winner/loser conditions and screen

Strech Goals: 
Menu/Instruction Screen,
Music,
Different Game Modes,
SQL Database to keep track of previous wins/losses,
Certain Ball Powerups (related to different game modes)

## Libraries
Cinder
